usecase "UC105: I which to list for all ships the MMSI, the total number of movements,\n Travelled Distance and Delta Distance." as UC105
usecase "UC106: Get the top-N ships with the most kilometres travelled and their average speed (MeanSOG)." as UC106
usecase "UC107: Return pairs of ships with routes with close departure/arrival \ncoordinates (no more than 5 Kms away) and with different Travelled Distance." as UC107
usecase "UC108: I want the team to develop the data model required to support\n all the functionality and to fulfill the purpose of the system to develop.\n This data model is to be designed following a systematic data modeling methodology. " as UC108
usecase "UC109: I want the team to draft an SQL script to test whether the database \n verifies all the data integrity restrictions that are required to fulfil \n the purpose of the system and the business constraints of the UoD" as UC109
usecase "UC110: I want the team to define the naming conventions to \n apply when defining identifiers or writing SQL or PL/SQL code.\n The naming conventions may evolve as new database and programming objects are known.\n The naming conventions guide should be organized in a way to facilitate its maintenance" as UC110
usecase "UC111: I want the team to create a SQL script to load the database\n with a minimum set of data sufficient to carry out data integrity verification \n and functional testing. This script shall produce a bootstrap report \n providing the number of tuples/rows in each relation/table" as UC111

usecase "UC307: I intend to get a warning whenever I issue a cargo manifest destined for a warehouse whose available capacity is insufficient to accommodate the new manifest." as UC307
usecase "UC308: I want to have a system that ensures that the number ofcontainers in a manifest does not exceed the ship's available capacity. " as UC308
usecase "UC309: I do not allow a cargo manifest for a particular ship to be registered in the system on a date when the ship is already occupied. " as UC309
usecase "UC310: I intend to have a map of the occupation of the existing resources in the port during a given month. " as UC310

usecase "UC311: I want to provide a database access account, \nwith login “crew” and password “bd7wd5aF”, which gives access exclusively to the \ninformation of the containers that are loaded on my ship. \nThe information about each container to be made available is: identifier, \ntype, position and load." as UC311
