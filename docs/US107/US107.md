## *Decision Making*
The information structure used to organize and store the requested ship objects in the US was a List that stores objects of type Treemap <Double, String>.
The Treemap organizes its objects by ascending criteria of the key, which in this case is the distance travelled, however, in the US it is requested in descending order, therefore, using Collection.reverseOrder().
As the ships are stored in a BST, by the inOrder() method, we obtain an ordered list of them, in ascending order. When comparing each ship with the following ones, and adding the comparison information that meets the requirements to the respective Treemap, in the end, the Treemap is added to the list, this is organized in ascending order of the MMSI of the first ship.
