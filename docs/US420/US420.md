## US420 - As the Ship Captain I want to know for a specific vessel, how much did the vessel sink, assuming that each container has half a ton of mass.
#### Acceptance Criteria [LAPR3]:
* Determine the total mass placed on the vessel and the pressure exerted by it on the water.
* Determine the difference in height that the vessel has suffered, above water level.


## US Logic

###### Since we are working with a vessel that sails through the waters of the sea, and the [densidade](https://www.todamateria.com.br/densidade-da-agua/) of sea water varies between 1.017 and 1.030 g/cm3, in the calculations we performed, opting for the value of 1.030 g/cm3.

###### As we are working on a specific vessel, we ask the user to enter the vessel's characteristics. The available ships are the following, worked on US417: 
* *Reefer Vessel* - VesselMassUnloaded=152*10^6KG - length=342m - Width=42m 
* *Container Ship* - VesselMassUnloaded=140*10^6KG - length=352m - Width=46m
* *Lake Freighter* - VesselMassUnloaded=147*10^6KG - length=346m - Width=30m 

###### The volume calculation formula consists of: volume = mass / density. That is, by the mass of the ship and by the density of the water we discover the volume.

###### To measure the difference in height, we fix the point on the deck, so we can use the formula for the volume of the parallelepiped. That is, find the height by dividing the volume by the product of the length by the width.
